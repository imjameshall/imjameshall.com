Around the same time I was toying with the idea of going freelance, my good friend [Michael van Tonder](https://dribbble.com/huntandsaw) was on a similar path and had a lead on a pretty interesting challenge. Michael was in discussions with Bryan Miles from Miles AG, a parent company that had four subsidiaries that specialized in various virtual staffing offerings. If you need an assistant, webmaster, bookkeeper or copywriter and aren’t necessarily worried about where in the world they are, the Miles AG group has a solution that can staff any of these roles for you.

### The Need to Consolidate
The Miles AG group had reached a point where they had 5 different sites (Ellipsis, Render, MAG Bookkeeping, ea Help, and Miles.AG) each focusing on one of their core competencies as well as an overarching site that helped describe the entire corporation’s goals at mind.

Each of these websites had its own WordPress instance with their own blog posts, pages, and CTAs to join the company. As one could imagine this ended up becoming quite convoluted with duplication of content and code across multiple WordPress installs.

### Five companies become one
The leadership team met with Hunt & Saw and went through the process of finding a singular name that would be synonymous with their company’s values and offerings. After a few rounds discussion and rewrites, the team decided on BELAY, and Michael went to work on creating the new brand.

The brand in short can be summed up in a single sentence:

> BELAY is an innovative virtual solutions company. We push conventional thinking, and align people with practices to help organizations grow.



### The Build

Once the designs and UX/IA was finalized I began to get started on the site. We had an aggressive timeline to complete the site for launch and needed to make sure we stayed on track. Michael was very supportive with answering any questions I may have had with any of the designs and how they would break down on the responsive grid. Even if we still couldn’t get it communicated clearly, he wouldn’t hesitate to give me a motion study.

By using these guides it really helps add more life and feeling to the sites we create. As you can see below, with the menu icon in use on the mobile site:

I like to take an iterative approach of development when working, and usually bring my designers into this method. It’s been my experience that no matter how picture perfect I think it may be, i'm going to be a few pixels off. Because of this, I like to get my developed pages to the designer as fast as possible so we can go over it together and fine tune as best as possible.   
  
A typical reply from Michael would be something like this:

To some developers this could be a huge point of stress and concern but for me it helps keep a constant line of communication with my designer at all times. Aside from these visual feedbacks, we also had a google spreadsheet full of screenshots and notes from the BELAY team, which really helped keep all of us on the same page for where we were during the project.

### The Launch
Coming up towards the launch date we were lucky to have a handful of key stakeholders helping us QA the site. We made sure to have stand-ups every other day to communicate any issues we may see and increased that cadence to twice a day on the last week prior to launch. The beauty of this team is that they understood the importance of being flexible when it came down to making decisions on critical items that were needed for launch.  We were able to launch on the exact date we had aimed for with a smooth deployment.
