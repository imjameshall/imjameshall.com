Right when I was toying with the idea of going freelance, my good friend Michael Van Tonder was on a similar path and had a lead on a pretty interesting challenge. Michael was in discussion with Bryan Miles from the Miles AG group, a parent company that had four subsidiaries that specialized in various virtual staffing offerings. If you need an assistant, webmaster, bookkeeper or copywriter and aren’t necessarily worried about where in the world they are, the Miles AG group has a solution that can staff any of these roles for you.

As we all move towards a more remote-work friendly environment, these companies have been skyrocketing in demand as well as popularity, moving the Miles AG group into a unique position for all of their brands.

## The Need to Consolidate
The Miles AG group had reached a point where they had 5 different sites (Ellipsis, Render, MAG Bookkeeping, ea Help, and Miles.AG) each focusing on one of their core competencies as well as an overarching site that helped describe the entire corporation’s goals at mind.

Each of these websites had its own wordpress instance with their own blog posts, pages, and CTAs to join the company. As one could imagine this ended up becoming quite convoluted with duplication of content and code necessary across multiple wordpress installs.

## Five companies become one
The leadership team met with Hunt & Saw and went through the process of finding a singular name that would be synonymous with their company’s values and offerings. After a few rounds discussion and rewrites, the team decided on BELAY, and Michael went to work on creating the new brand.

The brand in short can be summed up in a single sentence:

“BELAY is an innovative virtual solutions company. We push conventional thinking, and align people with practices to help organizations grow.”


## The Build

Once the designs and UX/IA was finalized I began to get started on the site. We had an aggressive timeline to complete the site by January 2nd for launch and needed to make sure we stayed on track. Michael was very supportive with answering any questions I may have had with any of the designs and how they would break down on the responsive grid. Even if we still couldn’t get it communicated clearly, he wouldn’t hesitate to give me a motion study.

By using these guides it really helps add more life and feeling to the sites we create. As you can see below, with the menu icon in use on the mobile site:

When working with my design team I typically approach it with an iterative way of thinking. It’s been my experience that no matter how picture perfect I think it may be, im gonna be a few pixels off. So I like to get my developed pages to the designer as fast as possible so we can go over it together and fine tune as best as possible.
The joy of being able to work with some of my best friends in the industry is that they won’t be thrown off by this type of approach. A typical reply from Michael would be something like this:

To some developers this could be a huge point of cause and concern but for me it helps keep communication with my designer at all times and really helps me ensure that we get pixel perfect output. The best part about this process is that you really can feel the progress as you move closed to the deadline. 


## The Launch
Coming up towards the launch date we we’re lucky to have a handful of key stakeholders helping us QA the site. We made sure to have standups every other day to communicate any issues we may see and increased that cadence to twice a day on the last week prior to launch. The beauty of this team is that they understood the importance of being flexible when it came down to making decisions on critical items that were needed for launch.  We were able to launch on the exact date we had aimed for with a smooth deployment.
