Every year Allure, regarded by beauty enthusiasts as “the authority on beauty,” awards over 200 products the coveted Allure Best of Beauty seal in categories from Eyes and Hair, to Cheap Thrills and Best Splurges.  The seal, the highest praise the magazine bestows, is respected by both consumers and the industry alike and drives significant sales for the products that earn it.

While at TEN in 2011 we were challenged with the task of transforming the content and rich photography of the Best of Beauty issue into a format that made sense for the mobile phone, allowing Allure readers to access the list of products, retailers, and locations quickly and easily from the palm of their hand.

Readers can browse and sort through the hundreds of top rated beauty products, locate stores nearby, buy online, or save favorites to create a shopping list.

Partner sponsors are integrated in the value-add “Beauty Spotlight” showcase.  The Spotlight allows manufacturers to present additional content to the Allure reader including tutorials, guides, quizzes and more. The utility focused approach has paid off and the section was visited by almost 25% of all app users.
