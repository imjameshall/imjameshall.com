Nickelodeon approached AgencyNet to create an app that children and parents could use together to go out and explore the world with their favorite cartoon character, Dora the Explorer.

We created an application that set up tasks for children to do in various areas around the cities. We would have the children go to a park and count the number of footsteps they take. While they were adventuring in the park, we had an augmented reality piece where they could take a picture with Dora and all of her friends.

Unfortunately as things sometimes do, the project was cancelled and the app didn't get to see the light of day. Me and Melanie (the designer of the application) were super bummed to hear that it was not going to be released. In hindsight I think we were really ahead of the times with this project and it just wasn't understood fully.

We still think it had a great look and feel and could have been a huge hit.
