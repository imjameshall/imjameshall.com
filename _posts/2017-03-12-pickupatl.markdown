Hackathons are always something that appeal to me as a developer. I usually do my own hackathons with all my little tinkering projects so going to an official one wasn't that hard for me.    

I recently attended a hackathon that was focused on helping the transit authority here in Atlanta, MARTA. They've recently been more open to working with the local development community by opening up their data and endpoints.  

I ended up forming a team with some of my old friends and coworkers from 352 to help solve a problem the city of Atlanta was trying to tackle.
