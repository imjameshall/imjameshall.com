The Home Depot partnered with MaxMedia to create a multi-channel experience giving a distinct point-of-view in the market of home d√©cor while promoting a fun, engaging, and non-intimidating environment for users.

This was the first catalog styled app I got to work on. It was based off seasonal ideas so we were putting out an issue every 3 months or so. I was lucky enough to do all of the development for three of the seasons.

The first issue I developed was the fall style guide:

In the fall guide I was able to play with a lot of fun functionality such as in view Video as well as a lot of page build ups. 


In the holiday style guide we got to play with a small amount of "VR" as well as hid some easter eggs. The video doesn't show it but in a specific view (the one where you can slide horizontally) if you shake the iPad, it would create a snow storm! You can view all of the other features here:
