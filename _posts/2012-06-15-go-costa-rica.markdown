While working at maxmedia, 22Squared approached us into building an application for their longtime client the tourism board of Costa Rica. 

They wanted to create an application where users could see a map of the country and pick and choose attractions and adventures that would make their perfect vacation.

After the user selected their locations they could create a video of their "precation" to get ready for the trip. There was a plethora of high res shots and videos that made for visually stunning videos that users could share to their networks.

I was able to play around with some of the more complicated frameworks in iOS so that I could merge videos together and then add a soundtrack to it based off an algorithm determining if it was more adventurous or more laid back. 

Here is a video of the app in action:
