I am currently the VP of Software Development at [352](http://www.352inc.com) in Atlanta, Ga. I currently manage roughly 20 software developers, qa engineers and front-end developers.  I also provide estimates and proof of concept applications for pitches when needed.  I enjoy the challenged of hearing an idea and figuring out how to execute that idea, regardless of how challenging.

Before my time here at 352, I was the Director of Technology at [MaxMedia](http://www.maxmedia.com). Before that I was the Associate Technology Director at [Ten Agency](http://agencyten.com) where I worked on such awesome clients as Bacardi, Island Def Jam, Mikeâ€™s Hard Lemonade and Anvil Knitwear.

Previously I was a Sr Developer where I would work on various projects ranging from .NET CMS Systems, Ruby on Rails project management software, and iOS applications.  You could consider me a jack of all trades developer.  If something needs to get done, I will figure the language out and dive in.

I also am the Co-Founder and Technical Director of [ImGame](http://imga.me), a social gaming network.  ImGame allows users to check in to their games, allowing all of their friends to stay current on what everyone is playing.  We released a beta page in july of 2011 which won a multitude of CSS awards and served as a talking point for the application before it was launched.  After the launch in December 2011, we won the FWA award for mobile app of the day.

When im not working you can catch me playing Gears of War, golfing, or just hanging out with all my friends.  I love watching Atlanta sports as well as really, REALLY bad horror movies.
